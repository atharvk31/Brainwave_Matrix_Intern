# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern
My name is Atharv Khumkar , i build a project on ATM Interface
This project is a simple ATM Interface simulation written in Python. It allows users to authenticate themselves using a PIN and perform basic ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing and depositing money, changing their PIN, and logging out.

How to Use
On starting the program, you'll be asked to enter your PIN. The default PIN is 1234.
After authentication, you will be presented with the following options:
1. Check Balance
2. Withdraw Money
3. Deposit Money
4. Change PIN
5. Logout
Select the desired option by entering the number corresponding to it.
If you choose to logout, the session will end, and you will need to authenticate again to perform any actions.
